🎉 Welcome to the curated collection of images generated by GPT-4o!

This repo gathers striking examples produced by OpenAI's newest multimodal model, GPT‑4o.

Most examples come from Twitter/X 🐦. May they spark ideas 💡 and turbo‑charge your creativity 🚀.

OpenAI’s latest cutting-edge image model, **gpt-image-1**, has been released, offering even more powerful image generation capabilities and is available via API.

<strong>Check out the 40+ brilliant examples below, carefully curated and translated by this project, sourced from OpenAI official materials, showcasing the power of `gpt-image-1`! 👇</strong>

-   Chinese Version: [OpenAI gpt-image-1: 40 Curated Prompt & Image Examples (Chinese)](./gpt-image-1/gpt-image-1.md)
-   English Version: [OpenAI gpt-image-1: 40 Curated Prompt & Image Examples](./gpt-image-1/gpt-image-1-en.md)

*Note: Both `gpt-image-1` and GPT-4o are OpenAI's latest image generation products, supported by largely the same underlying models. The main difference is that the former is currently accessed via API, while the latter powers official products like ChatGPT and Sora. `gpt-image-1` represents the newer iteration available through the API.*
